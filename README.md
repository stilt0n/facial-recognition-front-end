Facial Recognition App

## About this project
This is the front end for a web app that I made using React.  The app interacts with an Express.js back-end.  The allows for user registration and login and does facial recognition on user submitted image links.

## What I learned
This is my first full stack project and so I learned a lot about React, and about how to have a front-end, back-end, and SQL database interact.  I also recently deleted my back-end by mistake and learned a lesson in debugging the hard way as a result.  (The site is back up again now, I felt pretty stupid when I finally realized the problem).
