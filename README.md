##Facial Recognition App

If you want to see this app in action, it is up on Heroku here:  https://facial-recognition-app-stilt0n.herokuapp.com/

To see the backend of this app go here: https://github.com/stilt0n/facial-recognition-api

General notes:
I made this app using React for the front end and Express, Postgres and Knex for the back end.  The facial
recognition uses Clarifai's facial recognition API.

Notes for the future:
There are a couple bugs that I'm aware of in this app, and probably a few that I'm not aware of.  They're
pretty minor and the app mostly works, but I plan to fix them in the future.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
