Facial Recognition App

# THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY BROKEN, I WILL HOPEFULLY HAVE IT FIXED SOON
Update: I got a chance to try to figure out the problem with this app. I'm embarrassed to say that it looks like I deleted the entire back end off of Heroku to make room for another app. Now it's not a such a shock why the login has suddenly stopped working. I will hopefully have this fixed in the next couple of days.

If you want to see this app in action, it is up on Heroku here:  https://facial-recognition-app-stilt0n.herokuapp.com/

To see the backend of this app go here: https://github.com/stilt0n/facial-recognition-api

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
